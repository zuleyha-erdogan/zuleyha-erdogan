🚀 I am a software developer creating projects in computer vision and artificial intelligence using various technologies.

🐍 I work extensively with Python, especially leveraging OpenCV and YOLOv8 to build smart, real-time vision applications.

🌐 I have also worked with web development languages like HTML and CSS.

📚 I continuously improve myself through research and self-learning to stay up-to-date with new techniques.

📊 I plan to work on data science projects in the future as well.

🌟 I share my projects as open-source on GitHub, combining learning with contributing to the software development community.
